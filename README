patches:

- experiment container: not portable
    
    - set arch emulation flag

- experiment container: doesn't build
    
    - the REL git dependency always pulls the latest commit, so it doesn't match the requirements.txt
    - i took a commit from march 2022, when this paper was submitted

- experiment container: needs gpu
    
    - can't use docker in google colab due to cgroup configuration bug (there is no way to resolve this)
    - chose CPU only implementation
