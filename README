# patches

- experiment container: not portable
    
    - set arch emulation flag so it works on arm64

- experiment container: doesn't build
    
    - the REL git dependency always pulls the latest commit, so it doesn't match the requirements.txt
    - i took a commit from march 2022, when this paper was submitted

- experiment container: needs gpu
    
    - can't use docker in google colab due to cgroup configuration bug (there is no way to resolve this)
    - chose CPU only implementation

# errors

- updated dependencies (REL, flairNLP) means different word vocabulary, which means different topic coherence scores than the original paper  â†’ results changed but should have the same distribution
- dataset: spotify not available since dec 2023 (https://podcastsdataset.byspotify.com/)

# optimizations

- wrote a single docker compose file with all dependencies, no need to attach the terminal to a container
- formatted codebase
- dropped redundant shell scripts
