usage:

```
docker compose up -d

docker compose exec main python3.8 --version
```

patches:

- experiment container: doesn't build
    - the REL git dependency always pulls the latest commit, so it doesn't match the requirements.txt
    - i took a commit from march 2022, when this paper was submitted

- experiment container: needs gpu
    - can't use docker in google colab due to error: `failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: unable to apply cgroup configuration: mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/docker: read-only file system: unknown`
    - just wrote from scratch with CPU only container
