# patches

- container errors:

    - doesn't build
        - the REL git dependency always pulls the latest commit, so it doesn't match the requirements.txt
        - i took a commit from march 2022, when this paper was submitted
    - not portable
        - set arch emulation flag so it works on arm64
    - needs gpu
        - can't use docker in google colab due to cgroup configuration bug (there is no way to resolve this)
        - chose CPU only implementation, rewrite container config

- `entity_linking/radboud_entity_linker_batch.py` errors:

    - REL dependency missmatch: manually find and downgrade the right dependencies

# errors

- updated dependencies (REL, flairNLP) means different word vocabulary, which means different topic coherence scores than the original paper â†’ results changed but should have the same distribution
- dataset: spotify not available since dec 2023 (https://podcastsdataset.byspotify.com/)

# optimizations

- wrote a single docker compose file with all dependencies, no need to attach the terminal to a container
- formatted codebase
- dropped redundant shell scripts
